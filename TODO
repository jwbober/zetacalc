1. Our computations of IC1c are wasteful. There are binomial expansions in IC1c
and there are binomial expansions where IC1c is called, and these should
be combined.

2. Euler-Maclaurin summation case case can be optimized quite a bit.

3. Replace all of the calls to pow(I, n), pow(-I, n), etc. with new calls
to functions I_power, etc.

4. Replace many of the calls to pow(something) with multiplication.

5. Only calculate ExpAB using mpfr when b is small. (53 + 2 + log_2(epsilon b) < 0).
   (Similar condition may apply elsewhere.)

6. Check exp(2 pi w K) factor in front of IC1, IC6, IC4, IC4c. These will probably
often vanish, so we shouldn't compute them.

7. IC1c, IC7, IC9E, IC9H all should have tildes. This should be mentioned
somewhere in the code.

8. A lot of the comments in the code are wrong then j > 0. This should be fixed.
