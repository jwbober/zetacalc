       // which should be in the file w_coefficient.sage, and it
       
       // probably should not be edited manually. Instead, edit
       
       // that file, and rerun the script.

       // To run the script, you can, for example, run sage from
       
       // the command line, attach the file w_coefficient.sage,
       
       // and then run the function write_w_coefficient_file(limit)
       
       // with limit equal to the one more than the largest j you
       
       // wish these coefficients to be precomputed with.
